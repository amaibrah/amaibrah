- 👋 Hi, I’m Amani Ibrahim (amaibrah)
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, physics, the biomedical sciences, and cloud computing. I have a background in physics and did some biophysics research studying cholesterol's interactions with the cell membrane.
- I completed an intensive 6 week data science training course where I learned about predictive models, natural language processing, and some data visualization all using Python. At the end of the course, I completed a capstone project using data found on Kaggle and presented my findings.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning in depth. I am also working on improving my coding in Python, SQL, and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects
- 📫 How to reach me amani.eg.ibrahim@gmail.com
